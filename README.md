# Inkspiration

** PROJECT WIP **

## About
Inkspiration was created to tackle two problems in the tattoo industry today. 

The first problem is the lack of exposure tattoo sketches get. Most people who get tattoos don't tend to look at an artist's sketchbooks and usually have something in mind going in. 

The second problem are the consultations between the user and the artist. They are time-consuming and involve a lot of back and forth communication in-person. 

## Functionality 
Inkspiration connects users and tattoo artists together on a single platform. 

1. Tattoo artists will be able to upload their sketches to show on their profile to users & other artists. 
2. Users will be able to search tags + explore what they want for their tattoo by going through artists' profiles and checking out their sketches and style.
3. If a user finds a great sketch that they want for a tattoo, they can favorite it and edit/comment on it if there are some changes they would like the artist to make. Editting and making comments mimics a consultation with a tattoo artist. The artist can then make a new sketch on their own time and send it back to the user who requested it.   

4. Messaging on the platform between the user and the tattoo artist.
